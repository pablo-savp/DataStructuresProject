# DataStructuresProject
FASTA format genetic codes

The idea of the project was to process files with FAST format that contained several genetic codes.
To process these files different functions were used depending on what the user wished to do with the file.
Some functions were:
-Upload a file
-Count sequences
-List sequences
-Get a Histogram
-Know if a sequence exists in the loaded sequences
-Mask sequences
-Save File
-Exit

# Wha I learned
-C++ Data Structures
-File management
-Pointers
